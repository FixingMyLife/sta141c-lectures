## Grading


| Category      | Grade Percentage |
| ---           | ----             |
| Assignments   | 70%              |
| Project       | 25%              |
| Participation | 5%               |

- There will be around 5/6 assignments
- Assignments must be turned in by the due date. No late assignments are accepted.
- Participation will be based on your involvement in class, discussion, or office hours. The most subjective way to earn participation points is to have some interactions on Piazza. (A+ will be only given to those students with high participation)

## How to ask questions

I and TA will not respond to any emails about general questions about assignments and course materials. Please use piazza in regard to this matter. For private or sensitive questions you can do private posts on Piazza or email the instructor or TA.

Learn how to ask a question. Asking a question is an art, [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) has some good tips.

## Final Project

Details of project will be announced later.

## Assignment Rubric

(Adapted from Nick Ulle and Clark Fitzgerald )

Point values and weights may differ among assignments. This is to indicate what the most important aspects are, so that you spend your time on those that matter most. Check the homework submission page on Canvas to see what the point values are for each assignment.

The grading criteria are correctness, code quality, and communication. The following describes what an excellent homework solution should look like:

### Correctness

The report does the following:

solves all the questions contained in the prompt
makes conclusions that are supported by evidence in the data
discusses efficiency and limitations of the computation
cites any sources used
The attached code runs without modification.

### Code Quality

The code is idiomatic and efficient. Different steps of the data processing are logically organized into scripts and small, reusable functions. Variable names are descriptive. The style is consistent and easy to read.

### Communication

Plots include titles, axis labels, and legends or special annotations where appropriate. Tables include only columns of interest, are clearly explained in the body of the report, and not too large. Numbers are reported in human readable terms, i.e. 31 billion rather than 31415926535. Writing is clear, correct English.

### Inquisitiveness

The report points out anomalies or notable aspects of the data discovered over the course of the analysis. It discusses assumptions in the overall approach and examines how credible they are. It mentions ideas for extending or improving the analysis or the computation.
